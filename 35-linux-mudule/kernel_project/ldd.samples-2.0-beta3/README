These are the source files for the book "Linux Device Drivers".

This release is an ad-interim snapshot, while I and Jonathan Corbet
are working on the second edition of the book. Not all the sample code
is included, but what is there is tested with versions 2.0, 2.2 and
2.4 of the kernel (or only 2.0 and 2.2, when thus noted). Note that we
couldn't yet do massive testing, so keep the source with a grain of
salt.
