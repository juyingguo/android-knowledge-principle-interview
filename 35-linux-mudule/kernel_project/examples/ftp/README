These are the source files for the book "Linux Device Drivers".

Here you find the complete sources that have been included in the
book.  I have tested them as much as possible, but there might be some
problems left, especially with 2.1.43 (it's hard to test all of them
reliably when the underlying code base is continuously changing). In
particular, you might find some problems with "genksyms", whose syntax
changed between version 2.0 and 2.1 of the kernel.

The module "allocator" that you find in misc-progs is different from
the one I talk about in chapter "Mmap and DMA". The "aggressive"
technique didn't look promising in the real world, so I turned back to
allocating memory after "high_memory". See
misc-modules/allocator.README for details.
