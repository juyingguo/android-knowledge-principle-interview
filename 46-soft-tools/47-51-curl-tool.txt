		curl performs SSL certificate verification by default, using a "bundle"
		 of Certificate Authority (CA) public keys (CA certs). If the default
		 bundle file isn't adequate, you can specify an alternate file
		 using the --cacert option.
		If this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in
		 the bundle, the certificate verification probably failed due to a
		 problem with the certificate (it might be expired, or the name might
		 not match the domain name in the URL).
		If you'd like to turn off curl's verification of the certificate, use
		 the -k (or --insecure) option.
